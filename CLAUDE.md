# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Safe Harbor Lead Generation System - an autonomous lead generation pipeline for Safe Harbor Behavioral Health. It discovers organizations via Google Maps scraping, enriches leads, syncs to CRM, and runs automated email/phone campaigns.

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the main project
cd safe-harbor-lead-gen-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development (runs with ts-node)
npm run dev

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Production (runs compiled JS)
npm start

# Run Google Maps scraper manually
npm run scrape:maps
```

## Architecture

### Daily Pipeline Flow
The system runs scheduled tasks via `node-cron`:
1. **9:00 AM** - Lead Discovery (`scrapers/googleMapsScraper.ts`)
2. **9:30 AM** - Lead Enrichment (`enrichment/enrichLead.ts`)
3. **10:00 AM** - CRM Sync to GoHighLevel (`crm/ghl.ts`)
4. **10:30 AM** - Email Campaign (`marketing/emailService.ts`)
5. **11:00 AM** - Phone Campaign (`marketing/phoneService.ts`)
6. **5:00 PM** - Daily Analytics Report (`analytics/reporting.ts`)
7. **Continuous** - Webhook Handler (`web/webhookHandler.ts`)
